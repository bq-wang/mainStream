In this chapter discusses some of the subtleties involved in copying objects. we introduced the concept of shallow versus deep copying and discuss how to make copies under the foundation framework. 


to endow a class with the necessary copy and mutableCopy methods, we make our class to implement a method in conformance with the <NSCopying> protocol for making copies, if your class need to distinguish the mutable and immutable copies, you will need to 
implement a method according to the <NSMutableCopying> protocol...
