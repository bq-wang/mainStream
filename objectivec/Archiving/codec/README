If you ever try to do the following :

	[NSKeyedArchiver archiveRootObject: myAddressBook toFile: @"addrbook.arch"];

you may get error:

*** -[AddressBook encodeWithCoder:]: selector not recognized
*** Uncaught exception: <NSInvalidArgumentException>
*** -[AddressBook encodeWithCoder:]: selector not recognized
archiveTest: received signal: Trace/BPT trap


the reason is that your custom classes does not have this "encodeWithCoder: in the AddressBook class, but you never define such a method
