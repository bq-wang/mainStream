Application Services layer: Include supports for printing and graphics rendering, including Quartz, OpenGL, and QuickTime.
Cocoa Layer: Cocoa includes the Foundation, Core Data, and AppKit frameworks
Core Services: provides support at a lower or “core” level than that provided in the layers above it., you can find support for collections, networking, debugging, file management, folders, memory management, threads, time, and power.
Kernel: kernel provides the low-level communication to the hardware in the form of device drivers. It manages the system’s resources, which includes
scheduling programs for execution, managing memory and power, and performing basic I/O operations
