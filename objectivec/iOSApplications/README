this file will introduce you with the necessary steps on how to write iOS applications.

things that will be covered in this ReadME include the following.

the iOS SDK
Your first iPhone Application



* the iOS SDK
To write an iPhone application, you have to install Xcode adn the iOS SDK, this SDK is available free of charge from Apple's Web Site. To download the SDK, you will need to first register to be an Apple Developer. 

the discussion for the iOS here is 
	Xcode 4.2 
	iOS SDK 5


	
You will pay like $99 to Apple for the Activation code, to run the code on some iXX devices, but you can run that on some Apple simulator.


Apple distributes an iPhone simulator as part of the iOS SDK. The simulator replicates much of your iPhone environment, including its home screen, Safari web browser, Contacts application, and so on.



Project Structure:

there are those structures in the code..

	*project-nameAppDelegate.h/.m
An application delegate subclass is created for every new iOS application you create. In general, in this class are methods
that control the application’s execution.

	*view controller
A view controller is responsible for managing the display of one or more "views" on your iPhone's display

	*outlet
Your objects can also have instance variables whose values correspond to some control in your iPhone’s window, such as the name on a label or the text
displayed in an editable text box. These variables are known as outlets.
