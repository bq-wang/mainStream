In this chapter, you will leard about the features of the Objective-C language that makes it such a powerful programming and that distinguish it from some ohter object oriented 
programming languages such as C++. This chapter describes three key concepts: Polymorphism, dynamic  typing, and dynamic binding. Polymorphism enables programs to be developed
so that objects from different classes can define methods that share the same name. Dynamic typing defers the determination of the class that an object belongs to until the porgram 
executing. Dynamic binding defers the the determination of the actual methods to invoke on an object until the program execution time.
