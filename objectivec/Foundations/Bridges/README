in this file we will discuss some of the bridges that you may come to use in a day-2-day basis. 

for one of the challenges to work with the Objective-C objects with the C structures, e.g of this situations arise when you try to put a structure into a NSArray, or if you want to store a primitive int 
into some foundation classes. 


the rescue is the NSValue class.

   
the code fragement is as follow.


/*


CGPoint myPoint;
NSValue *pointObj;
NSMutableArray *touchPoints = [NSMutableArray array];
...
myPoint.x = 100; // set the point to (100, 200)
myPoint.y = 200;
...
pointObj = [NSValue valueWithPoint: myPoint]; // make it an object
[touchPoints addObject: pointObj];
